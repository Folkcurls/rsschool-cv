* ### About:
I'm _18_ years old and trying to find my place in this big and thrilling world! In my ongoing journey, sometimes finding place and some activivty can be _subtle_, and even _dreamlike_. And I was thinking, that front-end development can be very **interesting** field in my research in finding _myself_. I'm really **enjoying** to learn and also search for something new, _especially_ new information and knowledge, but sometimes it can be _hard_ to consume information that I don't find helpful for me of I find it boring. I'm **trying** my best to overcome that and became better me. Thats why I'm here and _ready_ to start my new adventure!
